# A Daffodil, in a Dungeon?
Daffodils stand for new beginnings. And in many ways, dungeons are symbols of death and decay. They are also places that spark our imagination and creativity. Daffodil aims to be this spark, a simplified restatement of the original TTRPG rules that ignited the birth of a genre. This site contains the rules to play our favourite dungeon crawling game and aims to present them in a concise fashion, so that we can get to the table faster. These rules can take you from level 1 to 3 without any additional resources, and should fit on single sheet of paper (front and back) if formatted properly. Rules modifications from the original game include defaulting to ascending armor class, the introduction of abstract distances, the simplification of the thief skills and the turn undead skill. The rules are compatible with both old TSR adventures as well with more modern OSR offerings. It is inspired by the original game, Swords & Wizardry, OSE, Cairn, Dungeon Crawl Classics, Shadowdark and Black Sword Hack.
