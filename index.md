# Dungeon Crawling your Way
This site presents the various rules available to play our favourite BX based dungeon crawling game and aims to present them in a modular fashion, so that you can choose which rules are right for you. It is inspired by games such as OSE, Swords & Wizardry, Cairn and Shadowdark. I will give some hints how these optional rules might affect the game.
