# About
This is a simple blog reviewing tabletop roleplaying adventures that I have run. I try to keep these reviews short and focussed: Are they fun? Are they easy to run? What is problematic? What did I learn from running this? I publish adventures over on [itch.io](tab:http://paradisebunny.itch.io) and you can find me on various OSR/NSR/Cthulhu Discords under the same moniker. Write me a message if you happen to live in Milan/Italy too! Now read some [posts](https://paradisebunny.bearblog.dev/blog/)!
