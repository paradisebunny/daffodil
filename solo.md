# Rules for Solo Play
This game, like any other TTRPG can be played solo. Here is a simple set of rules to do so. Use the two oracles below to replace the gamemaster.
## Yes-No Oracle
Ask a simple yes-no question and roll a d6 for the answer. If the result is likely, roll 2d6 and pick the lower result. If the result is unlikely, roll 2d6 and pick the higher result. If you roll doubles, ignore the result and something unexpected happens. Use the _Meaning Oracle_ to see what happens.

| Roll | Result     |
| ---- | ---------- |
| 1    | yes and... |
| 2    | yes        |
| 3    | yes but... |
| 4    | no but...  |
| 5    | no         |
| 6    | no and...  |

## Meaning Oracle
Grab a copy of any fantasy novel you have lying around (Tolkien's the Hobbit works great) and open a random page, point your finger on a random spot on that page. Find the next noun to learn about elements, the next verb to learn about actions or the next adjective to learn about descriptions. Repeat as often as needed.
