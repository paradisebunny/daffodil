# Rules for Solo Play
This game, like any other TTRPG can be played solo. Here is a simple set of rules to do so. Use the two oracles below to replace the gamemaster.
## Yes-No Oracle
Ask a simple yes-no question and react appropriatly. If the result is likely, roll two dice and pick the lower result. It the result is unlikely, roll two dice and pick the higher result. If you roll doubles, ignore the result and something unexpected happens. Use the _Meaning Oracle_ to see what happens.

| Roll | Result     |
| ---- | ---------- |
| 1    | yes and... |
| 2    | yes        |
| 3    | yes but... |
| 4    | no but...  |
| 5    | no         |
| 6    | no and...  |

## Meaning Oracle
Grab any book you have lying around and open a random page, point your finger on a random spot on that page. Find the nearest noun to learn about elements, the nearest verb to learn about actions or the nearest adjective to learn about descriptions.
