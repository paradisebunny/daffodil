# Creating Characters
## Ability Scores
Ability Scores are created by rolling 3d6 and assigning the results in the order below. 

__Strength__ – physical power. Your STR modifier adjusts your hit bonus for melee attacks. For Fighters it also modifies their damage rolls.

__Dexterity__ – agility and quickness. Your DEX modifier adjusts your hit bonus for ranged attacks and it adjusts your character’s AC.

__Constitution__ – endurance and vitality. The CON modifier adjusts your hit points for each hit die you roll for your character.

__Intelligence__ – reasoning and memory. Magic-Users with INT 15+ receive an additional 1st level spell.

__Wisdom__ – insight and perception. Clerics with WIS 15+ receive an additional 1st level spell.

__Charisma__ – force of personality. Modifies reaction rolls when first encountering intelligent monsters. 

## Attribute Bonus
Ability scores equal to or below 8 have a -1 modifier. Scores equal to or above 13 have a +1 modifier.

## Armor Class
Armor Class (AC) rates how difficult it is to hit someone. An unarmored person would have AC10, while one wearing chain armor would have AC14.
## Advancement
Each time a character survives an adventure, they gain a story: write down the title of the adventure on your character sheet (or make one up). Characters gain a level once they have a number of stories equal to their current level.

As the characters advance, they improve their saving throws. It is 15 at level 1, then reduced by 1 per level gained, but never lower than 5.
## Character Ancestries
__Dwarves__ easily recognize irregularities in stonework and find traps hidden therein on a 4 in 6. They also have the chance to find such a trap on a 1 in 6 without searching for it.

__Elves__ have keen senses find secret doors on a 4 in 6. They also have the chance to find such a door on a 1 in 6 without searching for it.

__Humans__ may switch the places of two ability scores at character creation.
