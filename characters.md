# Creating Characters
## Ability Scores
Ability Scores are created by rolling 3d6 and assigning the results in the order below. 

__Strength__ – measuring physical power. Your STR modifier adjusts your hit bonus for melee attacks. For Fighters it also modifies their damage rolls.

__Dexterity__ – measuring agility. Your DEX modifier adjusts your hit bonus for ranged attacks and it  adjusts your character’s AC.

__Constitution__ – measuring endurance. The CON modifier adjusts your hit points for each hit die you roll for your character.

__Intelligence__ – measuring reasoning and memory. Magic-Users use their INT modifier to lower their target's saving throw value.

__Wisdom__ – measuring perception and insight. Clerics with WIS 15+ receive an additional 1st lvl spell. Any character with a CHA score of 13+ gets an additional +5% bonus to all experience gained.

__Charisma__ – measuring force of personality. Modifies reaction rolls when first encountering intelligent monsters. Any character with a WIS score of 13+ gets an additional +5% bonus to all experience gained.

## Attribute Bonus
Ability scores below 8 have a -1 modifier. Scores above 13 have a +1 modifier. If your classes primary score is 13+ you get a 5% bonus to all experience you gain.
## Armor Class
Armor Class (AC) rates how difficult it is to hit someone. An unarmored person would have AC10, while one wearing chain armor would have AC14.
## Advancement
Characters gain levels by acquiring treasure. Total Gold value of a treasure equates the amount of experience gained. The GM might give out XP for other achievements too. Characters advance to level 2 when they reach the XP threshold indicated in their description. Every subsequent level is reached by acquiring double the XP of the previous level.
As the characters advance, they improve their saving throws. It is 15 at level 1, then reduced by 1 per level gained, but never lower than 5.
