# Creating Characters
## Ability Scores
Ability Scores are created by rolling 3d6 and assigning the results in the order below. 

__Strength__ – physical power. Your STR modifier adjusts your hit bonus for melee attacks. For Fighters it also modifies their damage rolls.

__Dexterity__ – agility and quickness. Your DEX modifier adjusts your hit bonus for ranged attacks and it  adjusts your character’s AC.

__Constitution__ – endurance and vitality. The CON modifier adjusts your hit points for each hit die you roll for your character.

__Intelligence__ – reasoning and memory. Magic-Users with INT 15+ receive an additional 1st level spell.

__Wisdom__ – insight and perception. Clerics with WIS 15+ receive an additional 1st level spell.

__Charisma__ – force of personality. Modifies reaction rolls when first encountering intelligent monsters. 

## Attribute Bonus
Ability scores below 8 have a -1 modifier. Scores above 13 have a +1 modifier. Optionally the the BX modifiers can be used as presented in the table below.

| **Ability Score** | **Bonus / Penalty** |
| ----------------- | ------------------- |
| 3                 | -3                  |
| 4-5               | -2                  |
| 6-8               | -1                  |
| 9-12              | 0                   |
| 13-15             | +1                  |
| 16-17             | +2                  |
| 18                | +3                  |

## Armor Class
Armor Class (AC) rates how difficult it is to hit someone. An unarmored person would have AC10, while one wearing chain armor would have AC14.
## Advancement
Characters gain levels by besting encounters. The typical encounter gives 2XP (e.g. characters lost HP and spent resources). This reward can be adjusted between 0XP (no challenge) and 4XP (barely survived). Encounters include combat and non-combat challenges. Characters advance to level 2 when they reach the 50XP. Every subsequent level is reached by acquiring double the XP of the previous level.
As the characters advance, they improve their saving throws. It is 15 at level 1, then reduced by 1 per level gained, but never lower than 5.
## Character Ancestries
__Dwarves__ Dwarves easily recognize irregularities in stonework and find traps hidden therein on a 4 in 6. They also have the chance to find such a trap on a 1 in 6 without searching for it.

__Elves__ Elves get +2 on saving throws vs spells. Elves have keen senses find secret doors on a 4 in 6. They also have the chance to find such a door on a 1 in 6 without searching for it.

__Humans__ may be any class. They may switch the places of two scores at character creation.
