# Playing the Game
## Time
A turn takes ten minutes. A combat round takes 1 minute.
## Movement
Distances are close, near and far. A character can take one action and move near, or skip his action and move far. A character can carry a maximum of 3000 coins at a time, slowing their movement down significantly.
## Damage and Death
When a character is hit, the amount of damage is subtracted from their hit points. When these  reach zero, the character is unconscious. They die at negative hit points equal to their level. Monsters die at 0 hit points.
## Healing
Characters recover 1 hit point per day if they eat a meal and have a night of uninterrupted rest.
## Saving Throws
A _saving throw_–also called a save–represents an attempt to resist a spell, a trap, a poison, a disease, or a similar threat. You don’t normally decide to make a saving throw; you are forced to make one because your character or monster is at risk of harm. Roll a d20 equal or over to succeed.

_Monster_ _Saving Throws_: The value of a monster's saving throw is calculated by subtracting the monster’s number of HD from 19.
## Encountering Monsters
Roll the table below when first encountering monsters and modify the roll with the leading characters CHA modifier.

| 2d6+CHA | Result      |
| ------- | ----------- |
| 0-2     | hostile     |
| 3-5     | unfriendly  |
| 6-8     | neutral     |
| 9-11    | indifferent |
| 12+     | friendly    |

## Combat
When the adventurers encounters hostile enemies, the action is structured in the following manner:

1. Determine Surprise
2. Roll Initiative
3. Party that won the roll acts first (moving, casting spells, attacking, etc.). Results take effect.
4. Party that lost the roll acts. Results take effect.
5. The round is completed. Start over from step two if combat has not been resolved.

#### Determine Surprise
A group of characters or monsters cannot be surprised if they are already aware of the presence of the adversaries. If both or one is not, roll for surprise: there is a 2 in 6 chance for the group to be surprised. If a side is surprised the other side gets a free round of actions before the initiative roll!
#### Rolling Initiative
Each side rolls a d6 for Initiative, highest roll wins. The winning side acts first (moving, attacking, and spell casting). The losing side follows after. If the initiative roll is tied both sides are acting simultaneously.
#### Types of Attacks
A melee attack is an attack made at close quarters (near). Ranged attacks are attacks with ranged weapons such as a bow or sling. When firing ranged attacks into melee, randomly determine if friend or foe is attacked.
#### The Attack Roll
To make an attack roll, rolls a d20 and adds any bonuses (HB if available, STR for melee attacks, DEX for ranged attacks, magic weapon boni if applicable) to the result. The attack roll hits if it is equal to or higher than the AC. Monster attacks add +1 to their attack roll for each HD they have. Roll damage according to the weapon's damage die (add STR bonus for fighter).
## The Usage Die
Items that are only available in limited quantities such as arrows, torches or rations utilize a usage die to represent their depletion. When a resource is used, roll the associated usage die. On a 1 or 2 you move down to the next smallest die for the next roll. If you roll a 1 or 2 on the smallest die (d4) the resource is depleted.
## Treasure
To create a treasure hoard add up the total XP value of the monsters the characters have overcome or outwitted and multiply it by 1d3+1. The result is the total gold value of the treasure, split up into valuables as you see fit.
