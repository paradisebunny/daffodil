# Playing the Game
## Time
A turn represents ten minutes, and a combat round is 1 minute.
## Movement
Distances are close, near and far. A character can take one action and move near, or skip his action and move far.
## Damage and Death
When a character is hit, the amount of damage is subtracted from their hit points. When these  reach zero, the character is unconscious. They die at negative hit points equal to their level. Monsters die at 0 hit points.
## Healing
Characters recover 1 hit point per day if they eat a meal and have a night of uninterrupted rest.
## Saving Throws
A _saving throw_–also called a save–represents an attempt to resist a spell, a trap, a poison, a disease, or a similar threat. You don’t normally decide to make a saving throw; you are forced to make one because your character or monster is at risk of harm. Roll a d20 equal or over to succeed.
_Monster_ _Saving Throws_: target number is calculated by subtracting the monster’s HD number from 19.
## Encountering Monsters
Roll the table below when first encountering monsters and modify the roll with the leading characters CHA modifier.

| 2d6+CHA | Result      |
| ------- | ----------- |
| 0-2     | hostile     |
| 3-5     | unfriendly  |
| 6-8     | neutral     |
| 9-11    | indifferent |
| 12+     | friendly    |

## Combat
When the party of adventurers comes into contact with hostile enemies, the order of events is as follows:

1. Determine Surprise
2. Roll Initiative.
3. Party with Initiative acts first (casting spells, attacking, etc.) and results take effect.
4. Party that lost Initiative acts, and their results take effect.
5. The round is complete; start over from step two if combat has not been resolved.

#### Determine Surprise
A group of characters or monsters cannot be surprised if they are already aware of the presence of the adversaries. If both or one is not, roll for surprise: there is a 2 in 6 chance for the group to be surprised. If a side is surprised the other side gets a free round of actions before the initiative roll!
#### Rolling Initiative
At the beginning of a combat round, each side rolls a d6 for Initiative, highest roll wins. The winning side acts first (moving, attacking, and spell casting). The losing side follows after. If the initiative roll is tied both sides are considered to be acting simultaneously.
#### Types of Attacks
A melee attack is an attack with hand-held weapons such as a sword, spear, or dagger. Ranged attacks are attacks with ranged weapons such as a bow or sling. When using ranged attacks into a melee, randomly determine friend or foe as your target.
#### The Attack Roll
To attack with a weapon, the player rolls a d20 and adds any bonuses (HB if available, STR for  melee attacks, DEX for ranged attacks, magic weapon boni if applicable) to the result. The total attack roll hits if equal to or higher than the AC. Monster attacks add +1 to their attack roll for each HD they have. Roll damage according to weapon (add STR bonus for fighter).
